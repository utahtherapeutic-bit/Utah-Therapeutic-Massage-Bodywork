## Float Therapy Guidance

Float therapy can benefit many people but isn’t right for everyone. Please review these helpful resources before booking your first session:

- [Who Should Not Use a Float Tank and Why](https://utahtherapeuticmassage.com/blog/)
- [The Ultimate Guide to Your First Float Tank Therapy Session](https://utahtherapeuticmassage.com/blog/)

Our staff will support your float experience but cannot determine medical suitability. If you’re unsure, consult your doctor before your session.

## Understanding Whiplash Recovery

It’s a common myth that whiplash heals in just weeks. Even minor collisions can cause long-term soft-tissue damage and misalignment. Studies show early arthritis often correlates with prior car accident injuries—making early, targeted treatment essential.
